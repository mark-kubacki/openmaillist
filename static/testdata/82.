Project description:
Openmailadmin is a little administration interface to every complete
IMAP mail server daemon. It supports every feature IMAP provides, and
fits in most MTA configurations. A key feature is the non-standard,
generic administration hierarchy which not only seperates "normal
users" from "administrators", but enables the mailserver-master to
create instances between them. You will be able to let other users
create their own sub-users and thus either share a single mail server
between different organizations or project your company's employee
structure. It excels with features such as regex addresses and folder
ACL management.
